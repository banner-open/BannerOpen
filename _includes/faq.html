            <a>Alcohol</a>
            <p>
                Alcohol must be 2 units or a standard drink, for example, a 4%
                can of 500ml lager is 2 units. If using a spirit or higher beer
                % the unit will have to be calculated and verified before the
                athlete can play. Day 1 - 6 cans (12 units) each worth a point
                (Min 5 cans/10 units to be consumed).
                </br>
                    Day 1 - 6 cans (12 units) each worth a point (Min 5 cans/10
                    units to be consumed)
                </br>
                    Day 2 - 27 cans* per team (9x3), 8 cans* worth 0.75 points and
                    final can* worth 1 point. Cans can be distributed among
                    teammates as the team sees fit once each player has drank the 5
                    can* minimum. *cans or 2 unit equivalent.
                </br>
                    There is a 2 point penalty per can if the 5 can minimum is not
                    met, a further one point penalty for vomiting. Cans must be
                    collected, quantities verified and brought back after the round.

            <p>
                Non golfers to play off 28. Golfers with a GUI to play their
                handicap.
            </p>
            <p>
                Day 1 - Singles play off their handicaps. Two ball scramble
                teams play off 18 Handicaps (Because Pa does not believe in yer
                ability to play of 13 and 14 respectively).
            </p>
            <p>
                Day 2 - Three ball scramble (calculated at 35% of Player A and
                25% of player Bs and 15% of Player Cs handicap).

            <a>Golf Rules and Etiquette</a>
            <p>
                Play Ready Golf. 4 golfers should finish 9 holes around the 2
                hour mark and the full 18 in around 4 hours. Try to play and
                drink to this pace.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do not walk across someones line on the putting green. If you
                have scratched a hole and cannot score on that hole, pick up
                your ball, drink and move on to the next hole rather than delay
                and waste time hitting meaningless shots.
            </p>
            <p>
                White stakes and Out of Bounds: Out-of-bounds brings the dreaded
                stroke-and-distance penalty: a golfer must apply a one-stroke
                penalty, return to the spot of the previous shot and hit it
                again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yellow Stakes: The penalty is one stroke. There are two options
                for putting a new ball into play. One is to return to the spot
                from which the previous stroke was played and hit it again. The
                second, and more commonly chosen option, is to take a drop on
                the line it came in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Red Stakes: Indicate a lateral water hazard. The golfer will
                apply the one-stroke penalty and take a drop. The drop can be
                taken within two club-lengths of the point where the ball
                entered the hazard, no nearer the hole. Or a golfer can go to
                the opposite side of the hazard and drop at a spot on the
                hazard's margin that is equidistant from the hole.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bunkers: You cannot ground your club in the sand, or take
                practice shots behind your ball if it will interfere with the
                sand and improve your lie. Doing so incurs a one stroke penalty.
                You can move your ball in the bunker 6 inches and no nearer the
                hole as rakes are out of use due to Covid.
